**Corrected Answer:**

The Hayli Gubbi volcano, located in the Afar region of northern Ethiopia, erupted for the first time in recorded history on November 23, 2025 (Source: [1]). The eruption sent thick plumes of smoke and ash up to nine miles into the sky (Source: [2]).

According to the Toulouse Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC), the ash clouds from the volcano drifted over Yemen, Oman, India, and northern Pakistan (Source: [3]). Simon Carn, a volcanologist at Michigan Technological University, confirmed that the ash cloud was spreading rapidly east in the subtropical jet stream, over the Arabian Sea towards NW India and Pakistan (Source: [4]).

The Hayli Gubbi volcano has been dormant for all of recorded history, with no known eruptions during the Holocene period, which began around 12,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age (Sources: [5] and [6]). The volcano's eruption could have economic implications for the local community of livestock herders, as many villages were covered in ash, leaving little land for their animals to graze on (Source: [7]).

The Afar region is prone to earthquakes, and a resident, Ahmed Abdela, reported hearing a loud sound and what he described as a shock wave during the eruption (Source: [8]). There were no casualties due to the eruption, but local officials expressed concerns for the livelihoods of nearby communities (Source: [9]).

The volcano continued erupting as of Monday evening local time, but has since stopped, according to the Volcanic Ash Advisory Center (Source: [10]).
